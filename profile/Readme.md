Woah, where are we? In GitHub are we? Oh, hii there! _ekhem_, let us introduce ourselves. We're Cantor, an Indonesian startup that aims for growth and utility-first, profit last mindset. Been here since 13th of February 2024', and since then we have **created meaningful integration within ourselves.** We're **proud** to be here, and joining the people-first community!

### 💻 Innovation first, yapping last.

The open source community is the 💗 heart of GitHub and fundamental to how we build software today. See for yourself:
